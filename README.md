#### Productivity

#### Enjoyment

1 is sad, 5 is ecstasy.

#### Teamwork

1 is in isolation, 5 is dream team.

#### Learning

1 is learned nothing, 5 is a field trip.

#### Serenity

1 is super-stressed, 5 is zen.

#### Average

Calculated as an average from the 5 preceding factor ratings for an overall view.

### Snapshot

This is a _snapshot in time_ collecting together all the relevant information for a health check.

This can include the scores, analysis, notes, timestamps etc - the Snapshot is a timestamped collection.

You would capture a snapshot when creating a survey. A call-to-action could say "_Create a snapshot_" when starting a new data collection for a team.
